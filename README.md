## Introduction
--------------------------------------
Attendance systems of old practices are not quite efficient now a days for keeping track on student's attendance.
Student Enrollment in schools and colleges increasing every year and taking each student attendance plays a very vital role. 
So, it is necessary to discuss the effective system which records the attendance of a student automatically.

Maintaining the attendance is very important in all the schools/colleges for checking the performance of students. 
Every school/college has its own method in this regard. 
Some are taking attendance of students manually using attendance registers or marking attendance sheets or file-based approach and 
some have adopted the methods of automatic attendance using some biometric techniques.
But in these methods, students must wait for a long time in making a queue at the time they enter inside the classroom. 

Many biometric systems are available in the market, but the key authentications are same in all the techniques. 
Every biometric system consists of enrollment process in which the unique feature of a person is stored in the database and after that,
there are some processes of identification and verification of the person. 
These two processes compare the biometric feature of a person with previously stored template captured at the time of enrolment of a student.
Biometric templates can be of many types like Fingerprints, Eye Iris, voice etc.
Our system uses the face recognition approach for the automatic attendance of the students in the classroom environment without student intervention.
The purpose of developing the new attendance management system is to computerize the traditional methods of taking the attendance.
Therefore, to drag the attention of students and make them interactive in observing technologies, we try to move on to the latest upcoming trends on developing attendance systems.
This is the reason for college/school attendance management system to come up with an approach that ensures a strong contribution of students in classrooms.
To track the attendance of the students, we have introduced the attendance management system.With the introduction of this attendance system,
skipping classes for students without the staff's knowledge have become difficult. 
Attendance management system is to count the number of students and urge students to attend the classes on time, to improve the quality of teaching.
 Usually, a rollcall is taken to determine whether the student is present in the class or not, which usually wastes a lot of time. 
 In recent years, with the emerging technology and with the development of deep learning, face recognition has made great achievements, 
 which leads us to a new way of thinking to solve the problem of student's enrolment. 
 So, to save time, the idea to count the number of students in a class automatically based on face recognition is incorporated. 
 This system is developed by using face recognition technique which is used to detect the face of an individual. 
 There are many different face recognition algorithms introduced to increase the efficiency of the system. 
 The system provides an increased accuracy due to the use of many features like Shape, colour, etc.
 The purpose of developing this system is advance the way of taking attendance in minimum time automatically.
